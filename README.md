# Neural-Networks-for-Regression-and-Classification
The pdf file contains a relatively large introduction to regression and classification problems, a detailed discussion of Neural Networks for regression and a shorter one for their use in classification.

The Jupyter notebooks describe general regression modeling on the Boston housing dataset and classification modeling on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.
